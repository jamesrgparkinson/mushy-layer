# Example inputs file for producing a checkpoint file which is at a higher resolution than a previous checkpoint file
# Usage: 
# 0) Edit this inputs file appropriately (see notes below)
# 1) compile the program in this directory:
#    $ cd /mushy-layer/setupNewRun
#    $ make all
# 2) run the program with this inputs file:
#    $ ./setupnewrun2d.Linux.64.mpiCC.gfortran.OPT.MPI.ex inputsRefine
# 3) That's it.

# Old checkpoint file that you want to refine:
inFile="/home/parkinsonjl/mnt/sharedStorage/highLeBifurcationDarcy/CR2.0RaC200Le2e10ChiCubedPermeabilitypts16-steady/chkCR2.0RaC200Le2e10ChiCubedPermeabilitypts16-162798.2d.hdf5"

# Inputs for the old simulation 
run_inputs="/home/parkinsonjl/mnt/sharedStorage/highLeBifurcationDarcy/CR2.0RaC200Le2e10ChiCubedPermeabilitypts16-steady/inputs"

# Where to save the new, higher resolution, checkpoint file to
outFile  = /home/parkinsonjl/convection-in-sea-ice/MushyLayer/setupNewRun/test.2d.hdf5

# Refinement factor
# e.g. refinement = 2 will turn a 128x256 domain into a 256x512 domain
# keep to powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...) to be safe
refinement = 2

# Uncomment below to set a new max_box_size 
# this is the maximum size of a box that the domain will be split into
# before sending each part of the domain off to different processors when 
# solving in parallel. If you're making the domain bigger, you probably want
# to increase this relative to the old simulation.
# box_size = 64
